# 📝 Personal Blog Platform

This is a full-stack personal blogging application that allows users to create, view, and delete blog posts. The application is designed using a **component-based frontend architecture** and a **RESTful backend API**. All data is persisted in a **PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase**, which also provides backend services such as authentication and row-level access control.

The backend handles routing, data validation, and communication with Supabase using the `@supabase/supabase-js` client. The frontend is built with React and uses `axios` to interact with the API. This project demonstrates a practical application of full-stack principles including client-server architecture, state management, API design, database integration, and secure deployment practices.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### ✅ Frontend
- **React** – component-based UI framework
- **Axios** – handles HTTP requests to backend
- **React Hooks** – state and effect management
- **CSS / Inline Styling** – for UI styling (can be replaced with Tailwind)

### ✅ Backend
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for backend
- **Express.js** – lightweight backend framework for routing
- **dotenv** – for managing environment variables
- **@supabase/supabase-js** – for direct communication with Supabase database

### ✅ Database
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** – cloud-hosted SQL database with real-time capabilities
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** – optional access control mechanism
- **UUIDs and Timestamps** – used for unique identification and tracking

## 🧠 Architectural Overview

This project follows a classic full-stack architecture:

- The **React frontend** communicates with an **Express.js backend** via RESTful HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE).
- The **Express server** acts as a middleware layer, handling routing, request parsing, and passing data to **Supabase**, which functions as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS) and hosts a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Supabase** also supports extensibility for future features such as authentication, file storage, role-based access control, and real-time subscriptions.
- The codebase is modular and scalable, allowing developers to add features like comment threads, user sessions, and admin dashboards without restructuring the core logic.

## 📈 Scalability & Extensibility

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced blog systems. The following upgrades can be built on top of this architecture:

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization** via Supabase Auth to restrict blog management access
- 🧾 **Markdown editor support** (using libraries like `react-markdown` or `Quill`)
- 🗂 **Rich media storage** using Supabase Storage or Cloudinary
- ⚙️ **CI/CD pipelines** via GitHub Actions
- 🔎 **Search functionality** using full-text PostgreSQL indexes
- 📊 **Analytics dashboard** for user engagement and content performance

---

## 🌐 Deployment Notes

- The **frontend** can be deployed to platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**.
- The **backend server** is compatible with platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**.
- Environment variables such as `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` must be securely configured in deployment environments.
